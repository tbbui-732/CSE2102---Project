# CSE2102---Project
Project for CSE2102 introduction to software engineering, sprint-based project. 

## Description
Built an interactive system (command-line based) for managing the inventory for a video streaming service, such as Netflix. This system will be built incrementally following a process that is similar to the agile approach.

## System 
Prompts user to insert a CSV-file containing movie or show information. 
The user can modify, add, or delete titles using the command-line.
Anything modified will automatically update the file.

## Side notes
The CSV-file can also be tab-delimited. The DataParser class can parse through a file containing both comma separated variables and tab separated variables.
